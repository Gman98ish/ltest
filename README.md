# ltest

*A custom test runner for clojure.test with detailed, coloured output and summaries*

The Clojure ltest test runner was inspired by the [LFE ltest runner]().


## Usage

### Running Multiple Tests

Collections of tests may be run with the `(ltest/run-tests)` function. The
following example passing just one test namespace, but any number may be
passed as additional arguments:

```clj
(ltest/run-tests 'ltest.group1.samples.sample2)
```

Here's is a screenshot of this call's result in the ltest dev environment

Note that this includes, in order:
* summary results
* failure listings
* error listings

### Running One Test

A similar approach with analagous reporting is available for running single
tests, but instead of a namespace, a namespace-qualified test function (as
var) is passed:

```clj
(ltest/run-test #'ltest.group1.samples.sample2/multiple-pass-test)
```

### Running a Suite

In ltest, test suites are aribitrary named groupings of tests. As with
`run-tests`, any number of namespaces my be provided in the `:nss` vector:

```clj
(ltest/run-suite {:name "Simple Suite"
                  :nss ['ltest.group1.samples.sample2]})
```

### Running Multiple Suites

You can also define multiple suites and run them together (useful for unit and
integration tests):

```clj
(def suite-1
  {:name "Arbitrary Division 1"
   :nss ['nogroup
         'ltest.group1.samples.sample0
         'ltest.group1.samples.sample1]})

(def suite-2
  {:name "Arbitrary Division 2"
   :nss [:ltest.group1.samples.sample2
         "ltest.group1.samples.sample3"
         'ltest.group2.samples.sample4
         'ltest.group2.samples.sample5
         'ltest.group2.samples.sample6
         'ltest.group2.samples.sample7]})

(def suites
  [suite-1 suite-2])

(ltest/run-suites suites)
```
